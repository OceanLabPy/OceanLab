    -> nmodes: the number of statiscally significant EOF modes (to be used for the series reconstruction)

    The method -- based on Beckers & Rixen (2003, JAOTech)

    The algorithm proposed by the authors is as follows.  (see Eqs. (13) and (14) from Beckers & Rixen)
        (I) Put zero in the GAPPY positions ("unbiased INITIAL GUESS, by assuming that the removed mean was unbiased).
        (II) Then you can have a first estimative of the EOFs.
        (III) You can reconstruct the series using the statiscally significant modes (e.g.: determined using Monte Carlo simulations as in Preisendorfer [1988] -- OBS: the authors propose another method using cross validation during the iterative process)
        (IV) Substitute the reconstructed series ONLY in the GAPPY positions in your original matrix.
        (V) Run steps (II), (III) and (IV) iteractively till its convergence (i.e. compare the reconstructed series at time t+1 with that at time t).
