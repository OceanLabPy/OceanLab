# OceanLab

Package of Python scripts for Oceanography  (Python +3.6)

## Code Example

Check `examples` folder in our [github repository](../../tree/master/examples).

## Installation

`pip install OceanLab`

## Modules

- **OA**
  - *vectoa()*: Objective analysis for vectorial fields;
  - *scaloa()*: Objective analysis for scalar fields;
- **DYN**
  - *dyn_amp()*: Makes the projection of every dynamical mode to velocity to obtain its amplitude;
  - *zeta()*: Calculates the vorticity field by velocity field;
  - *psi2uv()*: Calculates the velocity field by stream function scalar field;
  - *vmodes()*: Calculates the QG pressure modes from N2 profile;
  - *eqmodes()*: Calculates the equatorial pressure and vertical velocity modes from N2 profile;
- **EOF**
  - *eoft()*: Calculates the Empirical Orthogonal Functions;
  - *my_eof_interp()*: Fillgaps on matrix based on EOFs (translated from Cesar Rocha Matlab version);
  - *ceof()*: Performs the Complex (or Hilbert) Empirical Orthogonal Functions decomposition;
  - *reconstruct_ceof()*: Reconstructs the CEOF modes individually;
- **UTILS**
  - *argdistnear()*: Searchs the position of the closest points in an array to a reference point;
  - *meaneddy()*: Performs an eddy-mean decomposition with a low-pass filter;
